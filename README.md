## About The Repo

This is a monolithic application comprised of three parts: a UI, an API layer, and a backend database configuration.

### UI

The UI is the point of contact for our users. The UI is being developed mobile-first, and I intend to keep accessibility top of mind. THe app is deployed using Vercel because of how quickly and easily it allows me to make changes.

Technology:

- Next.js
- React
- SCSS
- Vercel

### API

The API directory holds all of the code that connects the frontend to the database.

Technology:

- Node.js
- Prisma

### Backend

The backend is where any code related to our database configuration lives

Technology:

- MySQL
- Prisma
